\# 🧭 Project Philosophy



\- \*\*Minimalism over complexity.\*\*  

&nbsp; Do the simplest thing that solves a real problem.



\- \*\*Composition over inheritance.\*\*  

&nbsp; Most abstractions should be interfaces or small utilities.



\- \*\*Predictability over magic.\*\*  

&nbsp; No hidden conventions. All behavior should be explicit.



\- \*\*Extensibility for real-world systems.\*\*  

&nbsp; Make it easy for teams to plug in their own transports,

&nbsp; serializers, envelopes, and policies.



\- \*\*Consistency across transports.\*\*  

&nbsp; RabbitMQ, Kafka, Azure Service Bus should feel the same for developers.
